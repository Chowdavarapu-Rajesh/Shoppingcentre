  <h2><b><i>TREND SETTER</i></b></h2>     
  
  <br> <br> <br> 
  <p>TREND SETTER established in 1970.From over a past 50 years we are having good relationship with all our customers.Our main branch is located in City named MAHABUBABD which is out of its Railwaystation,we are proud of being a first shop in our City. </p>
<p>The traditional supermarket occupies a large amount of floor space, usually on a single level. It is usually situated near a residential area in order to be convenient to consumers. The basic appeal is the availability of a broad selection of goods under a single roof, at relatively low prices.
 Other advantages include ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping hours that extend into the evening or even 24 hours of day.
 Supermarkets usually allocate large budgets to advertising, typically through newspapers. 
They also present elaborate in-shop displays of products. we are committed to inspiring personal style and helping our community and customers feel like the best version of themselves. 
We listen to our community and put them at the center of everything we do.
Giving you plenty of opportunities to have your voice heard is what keeps
TRENDSET fresh, relevant, and growing by leaps and bounds!
